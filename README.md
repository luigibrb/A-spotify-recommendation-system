# A-spotify-recommendation-system

This project is an R application of "Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets" by Y. Hu and Y. Koren and C. Volinsky, (2008). It has been part of the final project for my exam (and my collegues') in Statistical Learning.

You'll find an exhaustive report of this project in Report_SL_Project.pdf, and a schematic presentation in  Presentation_SL_Project.pdf.\
raccoltaDati.R has been used to gather personal data from 12 Spotify accounts through Spotify's API.\
mergingDati.R has been used to merge and clean the data.\
W-Als.R has been used to fit the model and evaluate results.
